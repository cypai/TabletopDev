        Develop tabletop games with your pawns!

        Pawns can now craft non-reusable games as additional recreation sources at Crafting Spots or Art Benches. Additionally, they provide mood bonuses, though awful games might make players angry instead.

        Includes the following:
        - RPG Campaign: Trains Social. Longer campaigns can be played more times, but take longer to make. Uses Artistic skill to make.
        After the campaign is finished, can still be played for very minor mood boosts.
        Minor note: Total usable sessions scales with colonists, so larger colonies can use the same campaign more often.

        - Escape Room: Trains Intellectual. Can only be played once per pawn, but trains more XP to compensate. Uses Crafting skill to make.

        After the games have been played, they are no longer useful and may be deconstructed or sold. However, just like real life, making games takes a long time and don't sell for much.

        Does not conflict with Tabletop Trove. Also, Tabletop Trove is more about infinitely-replayable games and decor, and this is not meant to be a replacement for it.

        New game ideas welcome, but please make sure they are consumable games. Standard board game suggestions can go to Tabletop Trove.

        If anyone can make better graphics, that would be highly appreciated! (I am not a graphic artist)

        Possible Future Ideas:
        - Crossword Puzzles: Low-work stackable which trains Intellectual?
        - Coloring Books: Stackable which trains Artistic?
        - Adding art stories from played games
